# M3EnigmaFirstPass
A quick and dirty M3 enigma emulator written without an eye for elegance or efficiency. 

This emulates the enigma machine in primary usage by the german military (sans the navy) in WW2. It includes reflectors B and C, and rotors I-V.

I wrote this while learning how the machine worked, and didn't plan anything out before writing most of the code. It works, miraculously.
I would like to also program an enigma machine cracker once I finish reading up on the various attacks on it.
I'll need to emulate many enigma machines (of a given model) at a time, and the faster they run the faster the cracking will go. So I would like to rewrite this with an eye for efficiency and flexibility.
